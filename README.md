# Final_Project_Comp260

<h1> The jupyter notebook for my Comp 260 final project. </h1> 
<p>For my project, I used the Amber molecular dynamics simulation suite to simulate 4 related chemical molecules (hexane, hexanol, hexanoic acid, and cyclic hexane as a control) in solvent. While these molecules are similar, we suspected that their different functional groups would result in subtle differences in their trajectories. </p>
<p> As a control, I tested hexanoic acid against cyclic hexane and found that the technique of using Kmeans clustering on the pair wise RMSD (root mean square deviation) of frames of the concatenated trajectories does indeed result in highlighting different structures. When testing hexane, hexanol, and hexanoic acid, the technique was unable to highlight conformational differences. I believe the technique worked correctly and that the contributions of the functional group are negligible. </p>
<p> Partially for fun and for use in my senior thesis, I also built a pipeline for converting topology data to numpy adjacency matrices and a GCN to use these matrices with <a href='https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl'> see here for archictecture I replicated </a>. The GCN was unable to identify structural differences in the control, but I suspect this is because of my choice of pooling layer. Excited to work more with GCN's in the future.</p>
